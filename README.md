### Hi, I'm Adrian! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ“¶

I develop (mostly) Mac tools for scanning, monitoring, and troubleshooting Wi-Fi networks. You can learn more about my apps on [my company's website](https://www.intuitibits.com).

I'm also a member of the [WLAN Pi](https://github.com/WLAN-Pi) team, a multi-purpose Wi-Fi analysis tool built on top of single-board computers and open-source software.

ðŸ”­ Some of my other projects you might find interesting:
  - [dfs-pulse-tester](https://github.com/adriangranados/dfs-pulse-tester): GNU Radio flow graph for emulating radar signal patters for DFS testing
  - [dot11anonymizer](https://github.com/adriangranados/dot11anonymizer): Anonymizes 802.11 Layer 2 information found in capture files (BSSID, SSSID, AP names, etc.)
  - [wlan-extcap](https://github.com/adriangranados/wlan-extcap): Wireshark extcap interface for remote wireless captures

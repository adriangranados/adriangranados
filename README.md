### Hi, I'm Adrian! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ“¶

I develop (mostly) Mac tools for scanning, monitoring, and troubleshooting Wi-Fi networks. You can learn more about my apps on my [company's website](https://www.intuitibits.com).

I'm also a member of the [WLAN Pi](https://github.com/WLAN-Pi) team, a multi-purpose Wi-Fi analysis tool built on top of single-board computers and open-source software.

ðŸ“Ÿ You can also find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/adriangranados) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriangranados/).
